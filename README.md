# Common Issues And Resolution

To resolve the error Refused to frame 'http://localhost:8080/' because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors 'self'"

Steps to Fix - CSP (Content Security Policy) error
==================================================
Login to Keycloak Admin Console

Go to http://localhost:8080
Login as admin.
Navigate to Realm Settings

Select your realm (e.g., myrealm).
Click on Realm Settings.
Modify Content Security Policy Headers

Go to the Security Defenses tab.

Under Headers, find the Content Security Policy setting.

Update frame-ancestors to allow your Angular applicationâ€™s origin.

For example, if your Angular app is running on http://localhost:4200, set:

frame-ancestors 'self' http://localhost:4200;

Save the changes.

Restart Keycloak If Keycloak was running before applying the changes, restart it to apply the new settings.
